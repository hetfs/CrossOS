To view all Wi-Fi passwords saved on your Windows computer using the Command Prompt, follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Prompt: Type "Command Prompt" in the Windows search bar, then click "Open."

2. Run Command: In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:
   ```
   netsh wlan show profiles
   ```

3. List Network Names: The command will display a list of network names (profiles) your device has connected to.

   ```
   netsh wlan show profile name="NETWORK_NAME" key=clear
   ```
   Replace "NETWORK_NAME" with the actual network name from the list.

Ensure you have administrative privileges to execute these commands.
