Oh My Posh has a CLI to help you select and install a Nerd Font (beta):
oh-my-posh font install

Now, each new PowerShell instance will start by importing Oh My Posh and setting your command line theme.
If you receive a script error when trying to open a new PowerShell instance,

you will need to launch PowerShell as an administrator and then use the following command:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
