Install using PowerShell from cmd.exe
This is the best method if you want to repeat it or include it in source control. It requires no change to your existing PowerShell to allow for remote unsigned scripts.

Create a file named installChocolatey.cmd with the following:
======================================================================
@echo off

SET DIR=%~dp0%

::download install.ps1
%systemroot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "((new-object net.webclient).DownloadFile('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1','%DIR%install.ps1'))"
::run installer
%systemroot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "& '%DIR%install.ps1' %*"


=====================================================================

You can also get to this file by going to https://community.chocolatey.org/installChocolatey.cmd.

If you prefer to have the install.ps1 file already, comment out the download line in the batch file and download the install.ps1 from chocolatey.org and save it as install.ps1 next to the installChocolatey.cmd file.

Run installChocolatey.cmd from an elevated cmd.exe command prompt and it will install the latest version of Chocolatey. You can not run this from powershell.exe without making changes to your execution policy.

NOTE: To create and save a .cmd file, please use a text editor and nothing fancy like Microsoft Word or OneNote.

====================================
For Windows
Install Chocolatey then install pre-requisites.
