What is Midnight Commander?
Managing files on their Linux servers in a command-line environment may seem daunting, time-consuming, and even dangerous. Well, not until you get to know Midnight Commander. But what is Midnight Commander anyway?

Midnight Commander makes working with files in the Linux terminal much easier and faster. But what about features? Midnight Commander includes a two-panel view, drag-and-drop, built-in file viewer, and editor — all you need for file management.

Another beauty of Midnight Commander is that it’s compatible with almost all Linux Bash shells and SSH clients and lets you remotely manage files on another computer! Even better? When using Midnight Commander with an SSH client, you’ll have all the features and functions of a GUI file manager.
