# OpenInWSL

[OpenInWSL](https://winget.run/pkg/opticos/openinwsl) is a utility that allows you to open files, folders, or specific paths in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment directly from Windows. It simplifies the process of accessing Windows files within WSL by providing a context menu option in File Explorer or command-line utilities to open the specified paths in WSL.

### Key Features:

- **File and Folder Access:** You can right-click on a file or folder in Windows Explorer and choose to open it in the WSL environment.
- **Path Conversion:** It converts Windows paths to their corresponding WSL paths, making it easier to interact with files across the two systems.
- **Integration:** OpenInWSL integrates seamlessly with Windows, providing a user-friendly way to work between Windows and WSL.
- **OpenInWSL** Integrates with **GWSL**, **wslg**, and any other **xservers**. (**GWSL** is recommended). OpenInWSL does not provide graphics.

### Common Use Cases:

- Developers who frequently switch between Windows and WSL for development tasks.
- Users who want to run Linux-specific tools or scripts on files stored in Windows.
- Those who prefer the WSL command-line environment but need to manage files using Windows Explorer.

 OpenInWSL lets you replace something like notepad.exe with [gedit](https://archive.flossmanuals.net/command-line/gedit.html) in WSL for opening text files. In this case Windows will now automatically open text files in gedit! This is especially useful if you use WSL Linux-based IDE’s to edit files stored on Windows. No more opening the WSL shell to manually open the file.

This utility streamlines workflows where interaction between the Windows and Linux environments is required, reducing the friction of manually navigating between the two systems.
