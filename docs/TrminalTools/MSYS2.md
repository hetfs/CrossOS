# What is MSYS2?

**MSYS2** is a software distribution and development platform for Windows that provides a native environment for building, installing, and running Windows software. It includes a Linux-like command-line terminal (*mintty*) and tools such as *bash*, version control systems (*git*, *subversion*), and build systems (*autotools*, *CMake*). MSYS2 is similar to Cygwin but focuses on providing a minimal, native Windows build environment.

Key features of MSYS2 include:

- **Command-line Terminal:** The *mintty* terminal offers a Linux-like command-line experience on Windows.
- **Package Management:** MSYS2 uses the *Pacman* package manager (like Arch Linux) for easy software installation, updates, and dependency management.
- **Native Toolchain Support:** Provides native Windows builds for compilers like GCC, Clang, and popular development tools such as CPython, Rust, Ruby, OpenSSL, FFmpeg, and more.

MSYS2 includes over 2,900 pre-built packages in its repository. For more information, visit [What is MSYS2?](https://www.msys2.org/) and [Who Is Using MSYS2?](https://www.msys2.org/).

## Installing MSYS2

### Method 1: Install MSYS2 via Winget

You can install MSYS2 using the Windows Package Manager (`winget`):

```bash
winget install -e --id MSYS2.MSYS2
```

This command automatically installs MSYS2. Once installed, proceed with the configuration steps below.

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Go to the [MSYS2 website](https://www.msys2.org/) and download the installer.
2. Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.

---

## Post-Installation: Updating MSYS2

After installation, it's important to update the system and base packages:

1. Open the MSYS2 terminal.
2. Update the system and package database:

```bash
pacman -Syu
```

3. If prompted to restart the terminal, do so. After restarting, complete the update:

```bash
pacman -Su
```

---

## Verifying the Installation

1. Open MSYS2 from the Start menu.
2. To verify the installation, run:

```bash
pacman --version
```

This confirms that `pacman` is installed and functional, ensuring you can manage MSYS2 packages.

## Installing Essential Toolchains and Utilities

### MINGW64 Toolchain (GCC)

To install the MINGW64 toolchain for C/C++ development:

```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
```

### CLANG64 Toolchain

For the Clang-based toolchain:

```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-clang mingw-w64-x86_64-tools-extra
```

### Git and Build Essentials

Install Git and development tools for building software:

```bash
pacman -S --needed git base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
```

### Optional Tools

To install additional tools like `nano` or `vim`:

```bash
pacman -S nano vim
```

---

## Python Development with MSYS2

For Python development, install the `python-devel` package:

```bash
pacman -S python-devel
```

You can check package details at [python-devel for MSYS2](https://packages.msys2.org/package/python-devel?variant=x86_64).

---

## Setting Up the PATH Environment Variable

To use MSYS2 tools globally from any terminal, add the relevant MSYS2 paths to your system's PATH:

1. Press `Windows + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press Enter.
2. In **System Properties**, go to the **Advanced** tab and click **Environment Variables**.
3. Add the MSYS2 paths (such as UCRT64, MINGW64, or CLANG64) to your system’s PATH variable.

---

## Verifying Tool Versions

After setup, verify that the tools are correctly installed by checking their versions:

```bash
gcc --version
g++ --version
gdb --version
clang --version
```

---

## Installing Additional Libraries and Tools

To install specific libraries or tools, use `pacman` to search and install:

```bash
pacman -Ss <package_name>   # Search for a package
pacman -S <package_name>    # Install a package
```

For example, to install the GNU Scientific Library (GSL):

```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gsl
```

## Understanding MSYS2 Environments

MSYS2 offers different environments for various types of development:

- **UCRT64:** Targets Universal C Runtime (UCRT)-based Windows apps.
- **MINGW64:** For mingw-w64-based Windows apps.
- **CLANG64:** For Clang-based Windows apps.
- **MSYS:** For Linux-like utilities ported to Windows.

When installing packages, ensure you use the correct prefix for your environment (e.g., `mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-` for UCRT64).

### Switching Environments

To work in a specific environment, start MSYS2 with the corresponding terminal shortcut and install the required tools using the appropriate prefix. For example, to install GCC for the UCRT64 environment:

```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
```

Use the `printenv` command to check the current environment variables.

## Updating MSYS2

To keep your system up to date, use the following command to update all packages:

```bash
pacman -Syuu
```

If the terminal closes during the update, reopen it and rerun the command to complete the update.

For more information, refer to:

[MSYS2 environments documentation](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/).
