# Brew Bundle Brewfile Tips

## Intro to Brew, Bundle, and Brewfile

If you are using a Mac as your development environment, you really should be usingÂ [Brew](https://brew.sh/). You probably should be using it if you are a power user as well, as it isn't really that difficult.

A key feature of Brew is its ability to set up your Mac to a known configuration. It does this a feature called Bundle that uses Brewfiles. As doing development, or experimenting with new apps can break your system, I can easily restore back to a known configuration, both on my primary Macs, but also in VMware Fusion instances where I do more testing, including testing on old versions of MacOS and new beta versions of MacOS.

A version of Brew also is available on Linux, but I mostly use apt-get on Debian. I am considering some cross-platform development scripts to use Brew instead.
