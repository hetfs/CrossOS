## **üåü Core Functions of an OS**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Resource Management**

- Controls CPU, RAM, storage, and peripherals
- Optimizes performance by balancing workloads

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Process & Task Handling**

- Executes, schedules, and monitors running programs
- Enables multitasking and background operations

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Allocation**

- Manages physical/virtual memory for applications
- Prevents crashes with smart resource distribution

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ File & Storage Systems**

- Organizes data into files/folders
- Manages permissions and access controls

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Access**

- Authenticates users and blocks unauthorized access
- Provides encryption and malware protection

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ User Interface**

- Delivers **GUI (Graphical)** or **CLI (Command-Line)** interaction

## **‚öôÔ∏è How an OS Works (Step-by-Step)**

1. **Boot-Up:** Loads firmware (BIOS/UEFI) ‚Üí Initializes hardware ‚Üí Starts OS
2. **Kernel Activation:** Core system takes over hardware management
3. **User Session:** Login via GUI (Desktop) or CLI (Terminal)
4. **App Execution:** Allocates CPU/RAM for programs
5. **Background Tasks:** Handles updates, security checks, and system maintenance
