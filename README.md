## ‚öôÔ∏è How an Operating System Works

1. **Boot Process:** Starts with BIOS or UEFI, which initializes hardware
2. **Kernel Load:** The OS kernel takes control and manages core operations
3. **User Login:** Users sign in via a GUI (Desktop) or CLI (Terminal)
4. **App Launch:** The OS assigns resources like CPU and memory to applications
5. **Background Services:** Handles updates, system processes, and security tasks
